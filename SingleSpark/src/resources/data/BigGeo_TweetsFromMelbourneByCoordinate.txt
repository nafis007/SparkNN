Senator - the best situation for children is having loving parents #loveisloveislove #ssm #qanda
So, we should never ever allow same sex marriage according to Eric #qanda @QandA love is clearly not part of the equation in marriage.
Eric Abetz believes that kids of #SSM don't know all of their biological parents? An incorrect assumption in my experience. #QandA

It's been an amazing week in #auspol when George Brandis ends up speaking words of wisdom
And so the "respectful" debate starts in Collingwood. Thanks @TurnbullMalcolm  #MarriageEquality #voteyes #auspol https://t.co/Py78U91ZoY
But #PaulineHanson should wear her burka everyday so she can get belittled and intimidated by all of her own supporters. #auspol
Just to be clear WE pay our taxes for politicians to act like dickheads... ffs #auspol
You can congratulate Brandis for giving Hanson a serve AND think his party are horrible. Some ppl need to get over partisanship. #auspol

Oh what a "tangled web" we weave re #climatechange &amp; "our #capitalistic #ideology", #shameful! Why? We "know better" with #facts in hand!
The #truth of #climatechange will only be #clarifying itself as will the #lies being told on behalf of the #dollar #ideology! #Ecology101
Did #money #create humanity as it ain't gonna #save us re #climatechange! The #capitalism #equation, it's #unsustainable #guaranteed!

The High Court said yes to the postal vote. Missed opportunity to also take the high ground.
So the ssm vote goes ahead as decreed by the High Court.  67% Australians were in favour last poll. Lets hope this vote exceeds that.
If the High Court had killed off the SSM vote..i wonder if the Govt would have forced a bill to reverse it..like they did with Dustys dad.

For the last 26 yrs, Aust has enjoyed an uninterrupted period of economic growth - a success unparalleled anywhere in the world.  #springst
While often overlooked, one of the drivers of that has been our federated system. #springst
As a state, Victoria has a proud history of being the intellectual and political driver of Commonwealth-State reform #springst
@villatoca @rBauhn Yes !
But for the benefits of federalism to be realised, states must be empowered and collaboration encouraged #springst
The founders were clear in their desire to protect distinct identities of six colonies, and powers of their respective parliaments #springst
Despite this, in 116 years since, there has been a gradual expansion of the Federal Government's role at the expense of the states #springst

There needs to be a reset of chaotic and punitive approach we have seen to date. States need to be treated as partners, not serfs #springst
To fix our federation we need to bring back that focus on the long term, rather than the day-to-day political battles #springst
A federation that delivers certainty not chaos, fairness not favouritism. And perhaps most importantly, that celebrates diversity #springst
