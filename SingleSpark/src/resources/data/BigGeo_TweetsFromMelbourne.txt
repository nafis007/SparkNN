For the last 26 yrs, Aust has enjoyed an uninterrupted period of economic growth - a success unparalleled anywhere in the world.  #springst
While often overlooked, one of the drivers of that has been our federated system. #springst
As a state, Victoria has a proud history of being the intellectual and political driver of Commonwealth-State reform #springst
But for the benefits of federalism to be realised, states must be empowered and collaboration encouraged #springst
The founders were clear in their desire to protect distinct identities of six colonies, and powers of their respective parliaments #springst
Despite this, in 116 years since, there has been a gradual expansion of the Federal Government's role at the expense of the states #springst
It isn't about making money. It's about the provision of critical infrastructure that'll enable Australian society‚Ä¶ https://t.co/VUqUzoZMhi
#follow Tausha Vargas @iamtausha
All too often, agreements are abandoned and funding withdrawn, while state governments are locked in to delivering these programs #springst
How can state governments be expected to budget, plan and deliver services when this occurs? #springst
Even more concerning than the chaotic ‚Äògo it alone‚Äô approach is that the federal government seems to have a real punitive streak #springst
On infra funding, Turnbull Gov is providing 10% of national funding to Vic, while sending an astonishing 45% to NSW #springst
Since elected, we‚Äôve created more than 280,000 new jobs - the majority full time. That's almost 40% of jobs created nationally #springst
The Federal Gov continues to act as a handbrake on state governments ‚Äì our reform agendas, and indeed in many ways, our progress #springst
#ThisIsAustralia Stopping #ftth #fttp and retaining copper as a ‚Äòmulti-technology mix‚Äô has caused this chaos‚Ä¶ https://t.co/matsdfQ3tI
We should explore ways of ensuring the Federal Government cannot unilaterally change agreements when it suits them #springst
If federal gov continues to fail to engage with state govs in a meaningful way, we must consider other options #springst
When there are sudden changes of direction, thought bubbles, or perceptions of inequity ‚Äì it makes future negotiations harder #springst
There needs to be a reset of chaotic and punitive approach we have seen to date. States need to be treated as partners, not serfs #springst
To fix our federation we need to bring back that focus on the long term, rather than the day-to-day political battles #springst
A federation that delivers certainty not chaos, fairness not favouritism. And perhaps most importantly, that celebrates diversity #springst
